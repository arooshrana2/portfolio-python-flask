                        This is an application fully developed in flask and MongoDB, with some use of front-end to
                        for making the users stick to it for a little longer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We often think of some beautiful lines or phrases or remember something worth sharing with others.
                        <br>
                        It can be as small as a line or as big as one would like. For such things we can use this micro blog to
                        say or remember whatever we want.
                    </p>
